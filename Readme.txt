About The Project
The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet powerful tool for analyzing customer support performance. By processing a standard CSV file of ticket data, the script generates actionable insights that can help a business understand support-team workload, efficiency, and customer satisfaction across different areas.

The script is written in pure Python, with no external dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to run in any standard Python environment.

Key Features
Overall Summary: Calculates total tickets, average resolution time, and average satisfaction score across all data.

Category Analysis: Provides a detailed breakdown of ticket volume, resolution time, and satisfaction for each support category (e.g., Technical, Billing, Account).

Agent Performance: Summarizes the number of tickets handled, average resolution time, and average satisfaction score for each individual support agent.

Zero Dependencies: Runs using only Python's built-in libraries (csv, typing), so no pip install is required.

Robust and Readable: Code includes type hints and docstrings for better maintainability and clarity.
